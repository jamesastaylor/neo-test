Sam’s a musician and bought a new guitar a few months back, he can see the option to &lt;claim&gt; this, but wants to be sure. Sam grants Jess access to his &lt;tax space&gt; and shows him how to claim the expense, they discuss whether to get the money back on the guitar in one sum or over 12 months. Kate persuades Sam it’d be better over the year, so he doesn’t spend it all at once. He reluctantly agrees, confirms the choice and watches his level update.

### Notes

Clients can grant access to third party organisations and individuals. Permission settings would allow access levels to be configured.

This is a great example of digital and physical touchpoints working together, some people will always require person to person validation. To keep things secure, as Jess interacts with the space, Sam receives notifications asking him to authorise these actions.
